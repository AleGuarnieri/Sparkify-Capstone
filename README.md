# Sparkify Capstone Project

##  Installation and Prerequisites
The project can be run using the Jupyter notebook provided, as long as pySpark is avaliable in the notebook

## Motivation
This project was implemented as part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and the goal is to perform churn analysis and prediction on users who
subscribed to a music streaming service called Sparkify. 

## File Description
Sparkify.ipynb: notebook containing all the steps starting from EDA to the final model training and prediction phases

## Summary and Details
The begining of the project is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis to familiarize
with the data, then the target column where it is defined if a user churned or not is created. After the feature engineering section
is dedicated to implementation or processing of the features, both categorical and numerical.
Finally a classifier is trained and tuned in order to predict churn.
